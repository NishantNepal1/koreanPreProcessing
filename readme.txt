This is the repo for preprocessing korean text. 
It is basically just a copy of Korean-text-pre-processing repo, but I modified the structure so we can process our data. 
There is also a script to remove stop words for [word, POS] type data. 
The stopword is also copied from a github repo. I will link them below.

To use the tokenizer, read the readme/txt included in the tokenizer folder.
